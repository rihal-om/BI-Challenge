## About the Dataset
### Context
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

Use this dataset to answer any question or conduct any analysis that best showcases your abilities and expertise in BI.

### Content
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

### Download
